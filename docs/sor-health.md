# SoR health pack

Read-only integrity + FTS / hybrid smoke for the live Mac mailroom SoR.
sor_health_pack is read-only. Does not write the DB, does not kill
embed jobs, and does not print message bodies, Keychain values, or app
passwords. Mini on a copy DB is OK and is not a second writer.

Human Terminal cards (one machine per card, one command per fence):
[ops-terminal.md](ops-terminal.md). Never-purge / local tombstone only:
[tombstone.md](tombstone.md).

## Path

`$MAILROOM_DB` or `$HOME/MailArchive/mailroom.sqlite` (`Path.home()` /
expanduser — no machine home hardcodes).

**Mini** may use a **copy** DB (for example a file copied from the MBP, or a
local `mailroom-copy`). That is a replica, not a second live writer. Do not
dual-write over SMB/NFS. One `embed_backfill` writer per `.sqlite`
(HARD DECK): [embed-backfill.md](embed-backfill.md).

## Recipes

```zsh
# MBP — SoR health + hybrid smoke
~/MailArchive/.venv/bin/python ~/MailArchive/scripts/sor_health_pack.py
```

```zsh
# Mini — SoR health + hybrid smoke (copy DB is OK; not a second writer)
~/MailArchive/.venv/bin/python ~/MailArchive/scripts/sor_health_pack.py
```

```zsh
# MBP — explicit SoR path
MAILROOM_DB=$HOME/MailArchive/mailroom.sqlite \
  ~/MailArchive/.venv/bin/python ~/MailArchive/scripts/sor_health_pack.py
```

Apple `/usr/bin/python3` cannot load sqlite-vec. Use the MailArchive venv
(same interpreter as hybrid retrieve).

## What it checks

- `PRAGMA integrity_check` — **hard fail** if not `ok`. If a working
  copy is not `ok` (or incremental write raises `sqlite3.DatabaseError`
  / malformed btree), set it **aside**. Recopy from a known-good source
  and re-check. Do not merge-back from a malformed file.
- Counts: `messages`, `message_embeddings` / vec rows, `embedding_meta`,
  coverage gap (messages without embeddings when the schema allows)
- FTS presence + smoke (`bill`, `Caddell`) — hit counts and top **subjects**
  only
- Hybrid smoke via existing `semantic_search.retrieve()` (`SDGE bill` +
  `Caddell`). When embeddings exist, reports whether some hits have a real
  `vec_rank` (not all missing/1000). If Ollama/embed is down, **fail-open**
  and say so
- Backup directory existence only: `$HOME/MailArchive/backups`
- Embed backfill / rem LaunchAgent patterns — PIDs and labels if found.
  Never `kill` / `bootout`

Coverage gaps and missing vec are **warnings** (exit 0). Missing DB is exit 2.

## Copy onto the Mac

The repo script lives at `scripts/sor_health_pack.py`. On the Mac it is
invoked from `~/MailArchive/scripts/` (same layout as `semantic_search.py`).
